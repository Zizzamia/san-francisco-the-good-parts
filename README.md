> San Francisco is the best!

I'm Leonardo Zizzamia, and this is a list of my favorite places in San Francisco. I’m always on the lookout for new things the city has to offer so I’ll be adding to the list periodically as I discover new favorites.
My taste is based on the traditions I was brought up with in Taranto, a seafood town in Southern Italy with incredible pastries, coffee, and simple (but delicious) flavors. 

I have been living in San Francisco since 2013, but I might miss an incredible restaurant, art gallery or Biergarten in my exploration, so please feel free to contact me on Twitter ([@zizzamia](https://twitter.com/zizzamia)) or send a Pull Request with your suggestions, I would love to uncover more of SF. Grazie!
